# reverse-image-finder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Glinkis/reverse-image-finder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Glinkis/reverse-image-finder)

The goal of this program is to allow you to search for images visually similar to each other.
This is very useful ff you for example get an image sent to you by mail, and you quickly need to find the corresponding image in your gallery or on a network drive.

The first time this program encounters an image, it will build a cached version of that image for quicker comparison the next time.

## To get started:
```
npm install // install dependencies
npm start // start a development version of the program
```
